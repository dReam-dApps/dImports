### About
The idea behind **dImports** is to be able to import and run Go dApps or code that is external to the executing program. Primarily designed for use with [Dero](https://dero.io) dApps, **dImports** aims to give users easy access to libraries of powerful dApps. Currently the `dimport` package is using [gore](https://github.com/x-motemen/gore) to import a Go package and run its `StartApp()`.

### StartApp
Simply put, `StartApp()` is a exportable version of a `main()`. It contains the overall logic and control flow of a application. To build a `StartApp()` that can be dimported, write a function called StartApp in a Go package and publish it. 
```
package mydapp

func StartApp() {
    // Your logic
}
```
- *mydapp must not be in top level of repo*

### Importing
To run a external `StartApp()` from your code.
```
package main

import "github.com/dReam-dApps/dImports/dimport"

func main() {
	path := "github.com/user/repo/mydapp"

	err := dimport.ImportAndStartApp(path)
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
}
```

### Build
dImports contains a CLI and GUI app which can be built from source.
